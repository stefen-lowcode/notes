### Simple Explanation of Concurrency

Concurrency in a simplest explanation is that two or more event happens at the same time, i can drink a coffee while you read, someone can sail a boat while the other is a look out, someone is struggling while the other is happy all happening at the same time.


### Concurrency in Computer Systems

In Computer Systems, concurrency means a single system operates and performs multiple task in all concurrently rather than one by one.

This isn't new Multitasking Operating  Systems that allow a single desktop computer to run  multiple applications at the same time  through task switching have been around for many years.

Some even have high-end machines that have multiple processors that enable genuine concurrency

What new is that increased prevalence of computers that can genuinely run multiple tasks in parallel rather than giving the illusion of doing so.


> **Fact**

Most desktop computers only have a single processor with single processing unit or core, and this remains true for many desktop back in the days
